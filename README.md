### Logo Redesign

This logo is a redesigned version created with the intention of making the brand more unique, refined, and visually connected. While redesigning, I focused on improving the overall structure, balance, and brand recall, ensuring the logo feels cohesive rather than just decorative.
The main concept behind the redesign was to integrate the symbol and the brand name into a single visual system. Instead of keeping the icon separate, I merged it with the wordmark so the logo feels unified and instantly recognizable. The organic floral element represents natural ingredients and purity, while the subtle arc and star details add a sense of care, glow, and premium quality, aligning with the skincare industry.

Design Principles Used in This Logo

1. Unity
All elements (icon, typography, and decorative lines) are visually connected, creating a single cohesive logo instead of separate parts.

2. Visual Hierarchy
The brand name “NIRMALA” is the primary focus, followed by the supporting icon and the tagline “organic skincare,” guiding the viewer’s eye naturally.

3. Balance
The logo uses asymmetrical balance, where the icon and curved elements are distributed in a way that feels stable and visually pleasing without strict symmetry.

4. Alignment
The symbol, text, and supporting elements are carefully aligned, ensuring consistency and a clean, professional appearance.

5. Repetition & Consistency
A consistent line style and visual weight are maintained across the floral icon, arc, and decorative stars to reinforce brand harmony.

6. Negative Space
Adequate spacing around elements allows the logo to breathe, preventing clutter and enhancing readability across different sizes.

7. Gestalt Principle (Continuity)
The curved line guides the viewer’s eye smoothly across the logo, creating a natural flow and improving memorability.

Final Outcome

The redesigned logo feels more  premium, and brand-focused. It is versatile, scalable, and suitable for multiple platforms such as websites, packaging, and social media, while maintaining a strong and unique brand identity.
